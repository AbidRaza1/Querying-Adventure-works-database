# Querying Adventure works database: 

The repository contains queries which are performed to retrieve, sort, join and aggregate Adventure works database. Every script has its own individual objective. We have developed VIEWS, PROCEDURES, INNER, OUTTER and FULL JOINS, LOOPS using T-SQL.

Reference: These projects/queries are heavily inspired by "Querying data with Transact SQL", a course by Microsoft Corporation.
